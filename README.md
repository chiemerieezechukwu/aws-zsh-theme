## Features

- Unlike the `robbyrussell` themes, This features a two-line layout giving you more space to write commands.
- Displays your current `$AWS_PROFILE` If you have one set. This becomes important if you're working with multiple aws profiles and frequently have to switch. Let's you know which profile is active with a glance.
- Shows the currently active kubernetes context
